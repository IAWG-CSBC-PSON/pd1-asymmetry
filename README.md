# PD1 asymmetry challenge

Challenge organizer: Yury Goltsev

## Create conda environment

Conda environments contain a set of packages required for a project,
keeping them separate from other projects.

To create a conda environment called `pd1` for the challenge:

    conda env create --name pd1 --file pd1-conda-environment.yaml

## Activate conda environment

    conda activate pd1

## Install asym python package

    pip install git+https://github.com/clemenshug/pd1-asymmetry.git

## Getting started

There's an example Jupyter notebook in this repository, with a starter
workflow.

## Getting help

Please use the hackathon Slack workspace. Please contact the organizers
if you don't yet have access.
